Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/word_do_word`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

gem 'word_do_word'

And then execute:

bundle install

Or install the library yourself using the command:

gem install word_do_word

Here is an example of how to use the word_do_word library:

require 'word_do_word'
## Documentation

You can find project documentation in the ./doc

## Usage

Use our gem for frequency analysis of text files. The input is the path to the folder with files in .txt format.
Our gem counts data from all files and returns a list of words found in the files, indicating the number of occurrences for each word.
You can install stop sheets and carry out limmetization.
