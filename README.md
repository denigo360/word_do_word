Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/word_do_word`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation
You can install your gem locally on your computer using 
the command gem install path to your gem.gem on the command line:

gem install (path_to_folder)word_do_word-0.1.0.gem

Here is an example of how to use the word_do_word library:

require 'word_do_word'
## Documentation

You can find project documentation in the ./doc

## Usage

Use our gem for frequency analysis of text files. The input is the path to the folder with files in .txt format.
Our gem counts data from all files and returns a list of words found in the files, indicating the number of occurrences for each word.
You can install stop sheets and carry out limmetization.
